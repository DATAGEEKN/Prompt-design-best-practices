            "\n",
            "The Monstera Deliciosa, also known as the Swiss Cheese Plant, is a popular houseplant known for its large, split leaves. With proper care, it can thrive indoors and become a stunning addition to your home. Here's a quick guide to help you keep your Monstera happy and healthy:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Light:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Monsteras prefer bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid direct sun, which can scorch the leaves.\n",
            "* East-facing or west-facing windows are ideal locations.\n",
            "* If your Monstera doesn't receive enough light, it may become leggy and lose its variegation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Watering:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Water your Monstera when the top inch of soil feels dry.\n",
            "* Allow excess water to drain freely from the pot to prevent root rot.\n",
            "* Overwatering is a common problem, so err on the side of underwatering.\n",
            "* You can also check the soil moisture with a moisture meter.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Humidity:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Monsteras enjoy high humidity (around 60%).\n",
            "* You can increase humidity by placing the pot on a pebble tray filled with water, grouping plants together, or using a humidifier.\n",
            "* Misting the leaves occasionally can also help, but avoid doing so in direct sunlight.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Soil:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Use a well-draining potting mix designed for Monsteras or aroid plants.\n",
            "* You can also create your own mix by combining equal parts potting soil, perlite, and coco coir.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Fertilizer:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Fertilize your Monstera monthly during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength.\n",
            "* Avoid fertilizing during the winter months.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Support:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* As your Monstera grows, it will need support to prevent its stems from becoming weak and floppy.\n",
            "* You can use a moss pole, trellis, or stake to provide support.\n",
            "* Encourage your Monstera to climb by gently tying its stems to the support.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Pruning:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Pruning is not necessary for Monsteras, but you can prune to shape the plant, encourage branching, or remove damaged leaves.\n",
            "* Use sharp, clean shears to make cuts just above a node.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Additional Tips:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Monsteras are relatively low-maintenance plants, but they appreciate occasional cleaning. Wipe their leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and debris.\n",
            "* Keep an eye out for pests such as spider mites and mealybugs. Treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or neem oil.\n",
            "* Be careful not to over-fertilize, as this can damage the roots.\n",
            "* Monsteras are mildly toxic to pets, so keep them out of reach.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these simple tips, you can keep your Monstera Deliciosa thriving and enjoy its beautiful foliage for years to come. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask! \n",

            "\n",
            "I love bright, indirect light. Think dappled sunlight filtering through a leafy canopy. Direct sun can scorch my leaves, so keep me away from harsh afternoon rays. A spot near a south- or west-facing window with sheer curtains is ideal. \n",

            "## Water\n",
            "\n",
            "I like to stay consistently moist but not soggy. Let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings, then give me a good soaking until the excess drains out the bottom of the pot. In winter, I'll need less water, so adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\n",

            "* **GPU:** A flexible workshop, capable of producing a wider range of products, but with potentially slower output and adjustments needed for different tasks.\n",
